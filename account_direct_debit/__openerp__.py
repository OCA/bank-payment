This module adds support for direct debit orders, analogous to payment orders.
A new entry in the Accounting/Payment menu allow you to create a direct debit
order that helps you to select any customer invoices for you to collect.

This module explicitely implements direct debit orders as applicable
in the Netherlands. Debit orders are advanced in total by the bank.
Amounts that cannot be debited or are canceled by account owners are
credited afterwards. Such a creditation is called a storno. This style of
direct debit order may not apply to your country.

This module depends on and is part of the banking addons for OpenERP. This set
of modules helps you to provide support for communications with your local
banking institutions. The banking addons are a continuation of Account Banking
Framework by Edusense BV. See https://launchpad.net/banking-addons.
