and 001.001.09. It follows the `SEPA credit transfer implementation guidelines <https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/what-we-do/epc-payment-schemes/sepa-credit-transfer/sepa-credit-transfer-rulebook-and>`_ of the `European Payments Council <https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu>`_.

This module also supports PAIN version 001.003.03 which is used in Germany.
