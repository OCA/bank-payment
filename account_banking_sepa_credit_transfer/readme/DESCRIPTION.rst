Module to export payment orders in SEPA XML file format.

SEPA PAIN (PAyment INitiation) is the new european standard for
Customer-to-Bank payment instructions. This module implements SEPA Credit
Transfer (SCT), more specifically PAIN versions 001.001.02, 001.001.03,
001.001.04 and 001.001.05. It is part of the ISO 20022 standard, available on
https://www.iso20022.org.

The Implementation Guidelines for SEPA Credit Transfer published by the
European Payments Council (https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu) use
PAIN version 001.001.03, so it's probably the version of PAIN that you should
try first.

It also includes pain.001.003.03 which is used in Germany instead of 001.001.03.
