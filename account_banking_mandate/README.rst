This module adds a generic model for banking mandates.
These mandates can be specialized to fit any banking mandates (such as sepa or lsv).

A banking mandate is attached to a bank account and represents an
authorization that the bank account owner gives to a company for a
specific operation (such as direct debit).
You can setup mandates from the accounting menu or directly from a bank
account.
