This module adds 2 fields on purchase orders: *Bank Account* and *Payment
Mode*. These fields are copied from partner to purchase order and then from
purchase order to supplier invoice.

This module is similar to the *purchase_payment* module; the main difference
is that it doesn't depend on the *account_payment_extension* module (it's not
the only module to conflict with *account_payment_extension*; all the SEPA
modules in the banking addons conflict with *account_payment_extension*).

Installation
============

This module depends on :

- purchase
- account_payment_partner

This module is part of the OCA/bank-payment suite.

Usage
=====

You are able to add a payment mode directly on a partner.
This payment mode is automatically associated to the purchase order, then on
related invoice.
This default value could be change in a draft purchase or draft invoice.
When you create a payment order, only invoices related to chosen payment mode
are displayed.
Invoices without any payment mode are displayed too.


This module doesn't add any feature, but it is used by several other modules.
