Account Payment Purchase
========================

This module adds 2 fields on purchase orders: *Bank Account* and *Payment
Mode*. These fields are copied from partner to purchase order and then from
purchase order to supplier invoice.

This module is similar to the *purchase_payment* module; the main difference
is that it doesn't depend on the *account_payment_extension* module (it's not
the only module to conflict with *account_payment_extension*; all the SEPA
modules in the banking addons conflict with *account_payment_extension*).

Installation
============

This module depends on :
- purchase
- account_payment_partner

This module is part of the OCA/bank-payment suite.

Configuration
=============

There is nothing to configure.

Usage
=====

You are able to add a payment mode directly on a partner.
This payment mode is automatically associated to the purchase order, then on related invoice. 
This default value could be change in a draft purchase or draft invoice.
When you create an payment order, only invoices related to chosen payment mode are displayed.
Invoices without any payment mode are displayed to.
