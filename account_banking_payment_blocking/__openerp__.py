    'description': """
    Prevent invoices under litigation to be proposed in payment orders.

    This module uses the 'blocked' flag that is present on move lines,
    to filter out lines proposed in payment orders.

    In addition it exposes this flag on the supplier invoice form
    so it is easier to block an invoice.
