Module to import HSBC format transation files (S.W.I.F.T MT940) and to export
payments for HSBC.net (PAYMUL).

Currently it is targetting UK market, due to country variances of the MT940 and
PAYMUL.

It is possible to extend this module to work with HSBC.net in other countries
and potentially other banks.

This module adds above import/export filter to the account_banking module.
All business logic is in account_banking module.

Initial release of this module was co-sponsored by Canonical.
