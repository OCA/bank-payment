This module allows to select a specific banking mandate (and thus, a
specific bank account) at contact level, so that when doing a debit
order, such mandate is used for the invoices issued to that contact.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Usage
=====

For selecting the mandate at contact level:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Customers > Customers*.
2. Open or create one contact that has a parent.
3. On the "..." page, fill *Contact Mandate*.
4. That mandate will be populated in the debit order.

Then the normal flow will be:

1. Go to Invoicing > Customers > Customer invoices.
2. Create a new invoice for that contact.
3. Post the invoice.
4. Add it to a payment order, by any of the options that you can check
   on the *account_payment_order* module.
5. The populated mandate will be the one on the contact.
