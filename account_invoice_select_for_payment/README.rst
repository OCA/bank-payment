This module allows to mark invoices as "selected for payment". This can be done
in the list view of invoices using a button in the first column of the view
which shows the selection status. This selection persists until a payment is
registered.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To mark an invoice as "selected for payment", click on the button before the
Number column. This will change the state and change the way the button is
displayed to a checked box.

When done, use the search filter "Selected for payment", and select all the
lines to give access to the Actions menu, in which you can select "Register
payment" to display the Payment wizard.

The selection is cleared when the wizard is displayed, whether the payment is
done or not.
