To mark an invoice as "selected for payment", click on the button before the
Number column. This will change the state and change the way the button is displayed to a checked box.
It's also possible to choose if the invoice is to pay or not directly in the form viex of the invoice.
When it's to pay, a ribbon appears.

When done, use the search filter "Selected for payment", and select all the
lines to give access to the Actions menu, in which you can select "Register
payment" to display the Payment wizard.

The selection is cleared when the wizard is displayed, whether the payment is done or not.

This module is linked to the module account_payment_order_select_for_payment to be able to select in a payment order only the to pay invoices.
