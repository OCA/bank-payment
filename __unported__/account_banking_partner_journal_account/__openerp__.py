This module allows to set alternative journal accounts on partners to use
as default accounts in imported bank statements.

This is useful when regular transactions on clearing accounts occur. Such
clearing accounts cannot usually be selected as default partner accounts
because they are neither of type 'payable' nor 'receivable' (or at least
never at the same time!). For the alternative journal accounts for bank
transactions, any reconcilable account can be selected.

When a transaction matches a specific move in the system, the account
from the move line takes still precedence so as not to impede
reconciliation.
