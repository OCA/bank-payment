On each payment mode it s possible to choose if we want to select bt default only the to pay invoice on payment order.

Once it's done, for the vendor bill and the customer credit note, it's possible to add a column in a tree view or, directly in the invoice, to choose If the invoice is to pay or not.

In the payment order, we can select only the to pay invoices with the button Take only to pay (which is selected bu default when the payment mode is configurated this way).
