On invoices, when you have selected some invoices which can be paid, the module adds the possibility to filter in the payment order, those invoices that have been marked as "To pay".

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

On each payment mode it s possible to choose if we want to select bt default only the to pay invoice on payment order.

Once it's done, for the vendor bill and the customer credit note, it's possible to add a column in a tree view or, directly in the invoice, to choose If the invoice is to pay or not.

In the payment order, we can select only the to pay invoices with the button Take only to pay (which is selected bu default when the payment mode is configurated this way).
