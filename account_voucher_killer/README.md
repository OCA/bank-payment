# Prevent the usage of voucher from invoices

This add-on disables the "Register Payment" button on
customer invoices and the "Pay" button on supplier invoices.

It also disable the menus "Sales Receipts", "Customer Payments", "Purchase Receipts", "Supplier Payments" and "Journal Vouchers".

More precisely, this module adds a group "Use voucher in Invoices"
and only users in that group see these buttons and menus.
