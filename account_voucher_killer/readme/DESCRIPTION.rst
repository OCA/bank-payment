This add-on disables the "Register Payment" button on
customer invoices and vendor bills.

It also disables the payments-related menus entries such as
"Customer Payments", "Supplier Payments"

More precisely, this module adds a group "Payments for Invoices"
and only users in that group see these buttons and menus.
