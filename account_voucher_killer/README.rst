Prevent the usage of voucher from invoices
==========================================

This add-on disables the "Register Payment" button on
customer invoices and the "Pay" button on supplier invoices.

It also disables the voucher-related menus entries such as 
"Sales Receipts", "Customer Payments", "Purchase Receipts", 
"Supplier Payments" and "Journal Vouchers", "Sales Receipts Analysis".

More precisely, this module adds a group "Use voucher in Invoices"
and only users in that group see these buttons and menus.
