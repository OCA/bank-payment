Account Banking - Payments Export Infrastructure
================================================

This module provide an infrastructure to export payment orders.
It includes some bug fixes and obvious enhancements to payment orders that will hopefully land in offical addons one
day.
This technical module provides the base infrastructure to export payment orders
for electronic banking. It provides the following technical features:

* a new payment.mode.type model
* payment.mode now has a mandatory type
* a better implementation of payment_mode.suitable_bank_types() based on
  payment.mode.type
* the "make payment" button launches a wizard depending on the
  payment.mode.type
* a manual payment mode type is provided as an example, with a default "do
  nothing" wizard

To enable the use of payment order to collect money for customers,
it adds a payment_order_type (payment|debit) as a basis of direct debit support
(this field becomes visible when account_direct_debit is installed).
