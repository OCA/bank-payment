Infrastructure to export payment orders plus some bug fixes and obvious
enhancements to payment orders that will hopefully land in offical addons one
day.

This technical module provides the base infrastructure to export payment orders
for electronic banking. It provides the following technical features:

* a new payment.mode.type model
* payment.mode now has a mandatory type
* a better implementation of payment_mode.suitable_bank_types() based on
  payment.mode.type
* the "make payment" button launches a wizard depending on the
  payment.mode.type
* a manual payment mode type is provided as an example, with a default "do
  nothing" wizard

To enable the use of payment order to collect money for customers,
it adds a payment_order_type (payment|debit) as a basis of direct debit support
(this field becomes visible when account_direct_debit is installed).

Bug fixes and enhancement that should land in official addons:

* make the search function of the payment export wizard extensible
* fix lp:1275478: allow payment of customer refunds
    ''',
    'installable': True,
