# All the code below aims at fixing one small issue in _to_pay_search()
# But _to_pay_search() is the search function of the field 'amount_to_pay'
# which is a field.function and these functions are not inheritable in OpenERP.
# So we have to inherit the field 'amount_to_pay' and duplicate the related
# functions
# If the patch that I proposed in this bug report
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject-addons/+bug/1275478
# is integrated in addons/account_payment, then we will be able to remove this
# file.         -- Alexis de Lattre
