====================
Account Payment Mode
====================

This module adds a new object *account.payment.mode*. In Odoo v8, this object was part of the *account_payment* module from the official addons, but this module was dropped by the editor in Odoo v9. This object is also designed to replace the *payment.method* object of the *sale\_payment\_method* module of the `e-commerce <https://github.com/OCA/e-commerce>`_ OCA project in v9.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to the menu *Account > Configuration > Management > Payment Mode*.

Usage
=====

This module doesn't add any feature, but it is used by several other modules.
